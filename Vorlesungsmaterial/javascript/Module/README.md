# JavaScript Module Exercise

## How to Run

To run this project, you can use `npx serve .` to serve the files locally. Follow the steps below:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd path/to/your/project
    ```

2. Install the `serve` package using npm:
    ```sh
    npm install -g serve
    ```
    This command installs the `serve` package globally on your system, allowing you to use it from any directory.

3. Use `npx serve .` to start a local server:
    ```sh
    npx serve .
    ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to the URL provided by `serve` (usually `http://localhost:5000`).

This will serve your files and allow you to run the JavaScript module exercise without CORS issues.
